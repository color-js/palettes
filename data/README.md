# Raw data

This directory contains the raw data used in the analysis.

## Summary data

The most useful data files are:
- [`palettes.json`](palettes.json) with data and stats about all known palettes
- [`hues.json`](hues.json) with data and stats about all known hues

These files are generated by the script in `_build/summary.mjs`.
It uses the metadata from [`palette_metadata.json`](palette_metadata.json) as input.

## Individual palettes

- `raw/` contains the raw files obtained from each paletteâ€™s repos.
They are in a variety of formats and schemas (JSON, CSS, SCSS, etc.)
- `palettes/` contains normalized palette data in JSON format.
The palette id is the filename.
The root object is an object literal.
Its keys are hue names (e.g. `"red"`) and their values are object literals with levels as keys and serialized colors as values.

Raw palette files are processed into the normalized files using the script in `_build/palette.mjs`.
